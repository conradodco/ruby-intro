# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things

fav_foods = ['tacos', 'burritos', 'nachos']
# puts fav_foods.inspect

# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# puts numbers.inspect

# mixed_array = ['tacos', 12, 3, 'nachos']
# puts mixed_array.inspect

# shopping_list = [['milk', 'cheese'], ['soap', 'toothpick']]
# puts shopping_list.inspect

# Accessing the array

puts fav_foods[1]


# Add to the array

# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
